# Recommendation-System-built-using-Numpy-and-Python
Designed and developed a recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset to explore collaborative filtering techniques. Applied
Pearson Correlation to implement User-Based and Item-Based KNN algorithms, and further enhanced model performance through a
hybrid approach combining user and item similarities. Gained hands-on experience in similarity metrics, neighbor selection, and
data-driven personalization.
